This is an initiative to create a browser based webservice for measuring latency of different services like EC2, SQS, 
SNS, and SimpleDB from multiple AWS Regions. The purpose of this tool is to help you understand relative latency performance from your 
browser to multiple regions so you can choose a AWS region that works best (low latency) for your usecase.

You are free to fork or submit patches. 
I haven't spent any time in refactoring the HTML/JS code so don't hesitate to cleanup if required:). 

I have hosted a service at http://www.cloudwatch.in for testing and general purpose usage by users interested in measuring latency to AWS regions. 
Do share it with others and spread the word!
